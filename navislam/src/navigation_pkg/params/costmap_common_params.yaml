  cost_scaling_factor:  3.0     # exponential rate at which the obstacle cost drops off (default: 10)

    # High cost scaling factor = Cost drops off rapidly as you move away from the obstacle.
    # This makes the robot more cautious near obstacles (stays further away).
    # Low cost scaling factor = Cost drops off slowly, so the robot can navigate closer to obstacles (less cautious).

  inflation_radius:     1.1    # max. distance from an obstacle at which costs are incurred for planning  # was 0.7   # was 0.5   --  last was 0.2


### Not Bad
# inflation_radius: 0.45  # Reduced
# cost_scaling_factor: 2.9  # Reduced to make inflation less aggressive


## Information

# The path planner consider the robot as a point

# A higher cost scaling factor increases the influence of obstacle costs in path planning, making the robot prioritize obstacle avoidance more strongly.


############ ---------------------------- ##############
# Inflation radius sets the absolute limit till which an object exerts influence or cost.
# Starting from the inflation radius and beyond, the costmap will have 0 cost due to the obstacle.

# Cost Scaling Factor : This factor defines how steeply or gradually the cost will decrease as we move farther away from the obstacle. It is inversely proportional to the cost of a cell.
# So a higher value means the costs decrease quickly as we move farther from an obstacle. A lower value would lead to a more gentle slope.
