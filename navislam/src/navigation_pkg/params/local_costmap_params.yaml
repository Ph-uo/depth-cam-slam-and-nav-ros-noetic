## In a ROS local costmap configuration file, the width and height parameters represent the dimensions of the costmap grid in terms of the number of cells.
## These dimensions define the size of the costmap area that is used by the robotâ€™s local planner
## to make decisions about obstacle avoidance and path planning.
